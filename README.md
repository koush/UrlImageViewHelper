## UrlImageViewHelper
UrlImageViewHelper will fill an ImageView with an image that is found at a URL.

### Sample Project

The sample will do a Google Image Search and load/show the results asynchronously.


### Usage

UrlImageViewHelper will automatically download, save, and cache all the image urls
the BitmapDrawables. Duplicate urls will not be loaded into memory twice.
Bitmap memory is managed by using a weak reference hash table, so as soon as the
image is no longer used by you, it will be garbage collected automatically.

Usage is simple:

```java
UrlImageViewHelper.setUrlDrawable(imageView, "http://example.com/image.png");
```


Want a placeholder image while it is being downloaded?

```java
UrlImageViewHelper.setUrlDrawable(imageView, "http://example.com/image.png", R.drawable.placeholder);
```


Don't want to use a placeholder resource, but a drawable instead?

```java
UrlImageViewHelper.setUrlDrawable(imageView, "http://example.com/image.png", drawable);
```


What if you want to preload images for snazzy fast loading?

```java
UrlImageViewHelper.loadUrlDrawable(context, "http://example.com/image.png");
```


What if you only want to cache the images for a minute?

```java
// Note that the 3rd argument "null" is an optional interstitial
// placeholder image.
UrlImageViewHelper.setUrlDrawable(imageView, "http://example.com/image.png", null, 60000);
```

UrlImageViewHelper is pretty smart. It can even load the photo for an Android contact
if given a Contact Content Provider URI.

```java
UrlImageViewHelper.setUrlDrawable(imageView, "content://com.android.contacts/contacts/1115", R.drawable.dummy_contact_photo);
```
